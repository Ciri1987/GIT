    <p>Where have you wandered,<br>
        My only child <br>
        Why are you not coming back? <br>
        Your mother is crying her eyes out <br>
        And I <br>
        In my dreams <br>
        Hear your voice <br></p>
    </div>
    <div class="refrain">
        <p>Father, will you take me away <br>
        Father will you take and save me from my fate <br>
        Father, will you take me away <br>
        Father will you take and save me from my fate<br></p>
    </div>
    <div class="verse2">
        <p>Wanted to go <br>
            Look for you <br>
            A hundred times <br>
            But I couldn’t leave her alone <br>
            The end of the world ruined our home <br>
            Yet didn’t destroy our hope <br>
            Acid rain is pouring down <br>
            On the caravans of shadows <br>
            Once they used to be humans <br>
            Dying of too much choice <br>
            Devoid of trust and empathy <br>
            They were passing each other <br>
            Now <br>
            Together <br>
            With raised hands <br>
            In tears <br>
            They call out at the sky <br>
    </div>
    <div class="refrain">
        <p>Father, will you take me away <br>
        Father will you take and save me from my fate <br>
        Father, will you take me away <br>
        Father will you take and save me from my fate<br></p>
